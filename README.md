# Command Repository

This repository stores all the commands I frequently use as a developer (the ones I always forget ðŸ¥¹).

## Command List

Here is a list of them:

* `npx create-vite@latest` - Used for a new React/Angular/Svelte project.
* `npm i` - Used for installing all the node modules along with `packages.json`.

### Required Scripts Commands in package.json

Here is a list of scripts to run in `package.json` (both frontend and backend):

```json
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
```
These scripts are used to build projects to production and deploy them. Install `gh-pages` first before using the deploy scripts.

### Adding Tailwind CSS to a Project

How to add Tailwind CSS to your project:

1. Install the following in your project directory:

    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```

2. Change your content inside your Tailwind config to:

    ```javascript
    content: [
        "./index.html",
        "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    ],
    ```

3. Add this inside your `index.css` file:

    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

4. Add this to your scripts object in your `package.json`:

    ```json
    "css": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./public/output.css --watch"
    ```

### Setting up Vitest (Tools for Testing React Apps) in Your Project

Here is a list of install commands used to set up Vitest and jsdom for application testing:

1. Install Vitest:

    ```bash
    npm i -D vitest
    ```

2. Add this to your scripts object in your `package.json`:

    ```json
    "test": "vitest"
    ```

3. Install jsdom and other packages:

    ```bash
    npm i -D jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
    ```

4. Make sure your Vite config looks exactly like this:

    ```javascript
    /// <reference types="vitest" />
    /// <reference types="vite/client" />

    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

    // https://vitejs.dev/config/
    export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [react()],
      test: {
        globals: true,
        environment: 'jsdom',
        css: true,
        setupFiles: './src/test/setup.ts',
      },
    });
    ```

5. Add the `types` key to your compiler options in your `tsconfig.json`:

    ```json
    "types": ["vitest/globals"]
    ```

6. Create a folder in your `src` folder named `test` and add a file named `setup.ts` inside it. Paste this inside the file:

    ```javascript
    import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
    ```

7. Install the UI version of the test results (gives out a clear version):

    ```bash
    npm i -D @vitest/ui
    ```

8. Add this to your `package.json` script objects to run your tests:

    ```json
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui"
    ```

9. import these from the react testing library to begin your test:

    ```javascript
    import {screen , render } from "@testing-library/react";
    ```


### Setting up Cypress Testing (Tools for React Apps) in Your Project

1. Install Cypress:

    ```bash
    npm install cypress --save-dev
    ```

2. Add this to your scripts object in your `package.json`:

    ```json
    "cy:open": "cypress open"
    ```

3. Choose Component testing and you be asked to choose your bundler, Cypress will automatically detect the bundler you are using for your react application and you can continue from there

4. Create a new component from the create new component and choose a new component to start with in your project

### Cypress TypeScript Configuration

To configure Cypress with TypeScript, follow these steps:

5. **Update `tsconfig.json`**:
   Include the Cypress folder in your TypeScript configuration to eliminate errors:
   ```json
   "include": ["src", "cypress"],
   ```

6. **Add Cypress Commands**:
   If the above step doesn't resolve the errors, add the mount to the Cypress interface by modifying the `commands.ts` file:
   ```typescript
   import { mount } from 'cypress/react';

   declare global {
     namespace Cypress {
       interface Chainable {
         mount: typeof mount;
       }
     }
   }

   Cypress.Commands.add('mount', mount);
   ```

7. **Handle Custom Commands**:
   To resolve similar errors for custom commands, update the `commands.ts` file:
   ```typescript
   import { mount } from 'cypress/react';

   declare global {
     namespace Cypress {
       interface Chainable {
         mount: typeof mount;
         dataCy(value: string): Chainable<JQuery<HTMLElement>>;
       }
     }
   }

   Cypress.Commands.add('mount', mount);

   Cypress.Commands.add('dataCy', (value) => {
     return cy.get(`[data-cy=${value}]`);
   });
   ```

8. **Fix Augmentations Errors**:
   To fix errors related to global scope augmentations, create a `cypress.d.ts` file in the root directory (or preferred location) of your project:
   ```typescript
   import { mount } from 'cypress/react';

   declare global {
     namespace Cypress {
       interface Chainable {
         mount: typeof mount;
         dataCy(value: string): Chainable<JQuery<HTMLElement>>;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

9. **Update `tsconfig.json`**:
   Point to the new typing file by updating the includes:
   ```json
   "include": ["src", "cypress", "./cypress.d.ts"],
   ```
