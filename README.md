# Command Repository

This repository stores all the commands I frequently use as a developer (the ones I always forget ðŸ¥¹).

## Command List

Here is a list of them:

* `npx create-vite@latest` - Used for a new React/Angular/Svelte project.
* `npm i` - Used for installing all the node modules along with `packages.json`.

### Required Scripts Commands in package.json

Here is a list of scripts to run in `package.json` (both frontend and backend):

```json
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
```
These scripts are used to build projects to production and deploy them. Install `gh-pages` first before using the deploy scripts.

### Adding Tailwind CSS to a Project

How to add Tailwind CSS to your project:

1. Install the following in your project directory:

    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```

2. Change your content inside your Tailwind config to:

    ```javascript
    content: [
        "./index.html",
        "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    ],
    ```

3. Add this inside your `index.css` file:

    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

4. Add this to your scripts object in your `package.json`:

    ```json
    "css": "npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./public/output.css --watch"
    ```

### Setting up Vitest (Tools for Testing Your Apps) in Your Project

Here is a list of install commands used to set up Vitest and jsdom for application testing:

1. Install Vitest:

    ```bash
    npm i -D vitest
    ```

2. Add this to your scripts object in your `package.json`:

    ```json
    "test": "vitest"
    ```

3. Install jsdom and other packages:

    ```bash
    npm i -D jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
    ```

4. Make sure your Vite config looks exactly like this:

    ```javascript
    /// <reference types="vitest" />
    /// <reference types="vite/client" />

    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

    // https://vitejs.dev/config/
    export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [react()],
      test: {
        globals: true,
        environment: 'jsdom',
        css: true,
        setupFiles: './src/test/setup.ts',
      },
    });
    ```

5. Add the `types` key to your compiler options in your `tsconfig.json`:

    ```json
    "types": ["vitest/globals"]
    ```

6. Create a folder in your `src` folder named `test` and add a file named `setup.ts` inside it. Paste this inside the file:

    ```javascript
    import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
    ```

7. Install the UI version of the test results (gives out a clear version):

    ```bash
    npm i -D @vitest/ui
    ```

8. Add this to your `package.json` script objects to run your tests:

    ```json
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui"
    ```
